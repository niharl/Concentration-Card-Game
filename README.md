# Concentration-Card-Game
A Pygame implementation of a solitaire memory/concentration card game.

## Set-up
This version runs on Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.0. 

To install Pygame, run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip3 install pygame
```

To run, simply run the memory_game.py file.

## Gameplay
Select the following options on the homepage:
* Level: the total number of cards displayed
* Speed: the time you have to see a card when you flip it
* Mode: unlimited, limited moves, or timed

Once the game starts, the aim is to make all cards disappear. Cards are selected and flipped in pairs.  If the two cards selected match, they disappear.  Otherwise, there is a limited amount of time (determined by the speed) to see and memorize the two cards before they flip back over.
